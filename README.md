# sign-up-form

A basic sign-up form for a fictional service, created using my knowledge of HTML & CSS thus far. 

<strong>Features:</strong> This webpage features a left side with image banner and logo, and a right side with a registration form. There is some responsiveness implemented for different window sizes and zoom levels. Accessibility features were implemented when filling out the form, including custom focus indicators and error messages. Webpage was tested on Chrome & Firefox. 

<strong>Caveats:</strong> Responsiveness for mobile/other devices is out of the scope for this project. No Javascript validation for the form - out of scope. Did not test on all major browsers, only Chrome and Firefox. Limited custom styling for checkboxes, and omitted radio, select, & textarea controls due to time constraint. May not adhere to all accessibility guidelines - out of scope. 

## New concepts used
- svg
- emmet
- html semantics - using the correct elements (limited. will be taught later on)
- css normalization/reset
- css properties including text styles & shadows, positioning, custom font
- custom css properties
- advanced selectors: siblings & descendents, psuedo-class & elements
- responsive design: relative units, min/max functions & properties 
- basic accessibility with the form controls and semantics (following the Accessibility section on MDN documentation pages)
- basic testing for browser compatibility
- devtools state testing
- form semantics, style, & validation

## Reflection
So many concepts. At first I was overwhelmed with how many concepts I was tasked with practicing/implementing, but I tackled them one at a time in a sensible order.  

<strong>Some things I did well on: </strong>Structuring the page and form using semantically correct elements and without much redundancy (I hope). Creating a responsive UX in filling out the form. Practicing all the major concepts learned (see section New concepts used)

<strong>I can improve on: </strong>(1) Better plan out the layout and properties needed - I have only ever written psuedocode and tested things "from the ground up" for Javascript, but I want to try doing so for both HTML and CSS to catch bugs in my layout early on and preclude major refactoring later on. (2) Going faster: Ties into the previous point - better planning earlier on pays off later despite how I feel it's wasting time. 

Time spent: about 20 hours. Additional time spent reviewing others' projects: about 2 hours.

### Others' projects I looked at: 
- [semproject's Form](https://semproject-stupid.github.io/sign-up-form/) - Super nice looking, and has checkbox, radio buttons, & textarea. The sidebar is very interesting as it accomplished what I couldn't â€” getting the background image to be fixed without it disturbing the rest of the document flow. That is something I will keep in mind for future projects. 
- [maru's Form](https://github.com/renegade-404/sign-up-form) - Wrote a 'planning' document containing psuedocode for the HTML. I have only ever written psuedocode for Javascript, so I will try out this practice. It might be helpful in planning my layout and what style properties each part of the page has.
- [sh4mblesss Form](https://github.com/arvingarciabtw/the-odin-project/tree/main/full-stack-javascript/fsj-01-intermediate-html-and-css/06-sign-up-form) - An example of semantic HTML, which helped me improve mine (see commits). Although this topic I've discovered is out of scope for this project, I'm happy I was able get some reps in myself and see someone else implement it as well. 
- [htkael's Form](https://github.com/htkael/Forms) Finished this in 2 days?! I clearly can go faster, lol. I believe I do things comprehensively so that inherently takes more time, but I can still go faster, like with better planning.
